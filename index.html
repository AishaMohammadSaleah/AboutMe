                    Hi, I am Aisha Saleh, a third-year student majoring in Computer Science in the job market.
                    I love diving into the details of programs and understanding codes accurately. 
                    I prefer to work independently and tend to anticipate all aspects of project development. 
                    I joined the Full Stack course because I want to develop my skills in all aspects of building applications, 
                    whether from the front-end or the back-end. This will enable me to transform my ideas into integrated projects without having to rely on others.
                    I also see that these skills will open up broader opportunities for me in the field of technology and help me deal with technical challenges better,
                    which is in line with my desire to work accurately and independently.
                </p>

                    My city, Nablus, is a beautiful place located in the north of Palestine, 
                    known for its stunning nature and rich history.
                    It is surrounded by the twin mountains, Ebal and Gerizim, giving it a unique charm nestled between the hills.
                    I am proud of my city because it blends tradition with modernity; its old markets, like the historic Old City, 
                    are filled with life and still carry the spirit of the past. Nablus is also famous for its delicious knafeh,
                    one of the most renowned desserts in Palestine. Walking through its streets, you feel the warmth and generosity of its people,
                    with a sense of closeness and community everywhere. Nablus is not just where I liveâ€”it's a part of my identity and memories,
                    with every corner holding a story about me and its kind-hearted residents.
